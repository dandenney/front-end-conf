        <li>August 22, 2014 at the Portland Center Stage aka The Armory.</li>
        <li>Same deal as in the past: 50 minute window and we'll hook up travel, hotel, and some fun.</li>
        <li>This will be the last Front-End Conf in this format. We'll be changing things up in the future.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="invite--personal">Hi Sarah! I hope your recent experiences haven't discouraged you from speaking over here. We'd love to have you come out and enjoy Portland with us if it works with your schedule.</p>
