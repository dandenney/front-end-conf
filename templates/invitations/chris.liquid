      <h1>Join us in Portland?</h1>

      <ol class="invite--details">
        <li>August 22, 2014 at the Portland Center Stage aka The Armory.</li>
        <li>Same deal as in the past: 50 minute window and we'll hook up travel, hotel, and some fun.</li>
        <li>This will be the last Front-End Conf in this format. We'll be changing things up in the future.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="invite--personal">Hey Chris! No pressure, but I really hope you can make it. You're Mr. Front-End and your original "yes" gave me the confidence to run this whole thing.</p>
