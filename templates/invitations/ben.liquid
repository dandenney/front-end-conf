        <li>August 22, 2014 at the Portland Center Stage aka The Armory.</li>
        <li>Same deal as in the past: 50 minute window and we'll hook up travel, hotel, and some fun.</li>
        <li>This will be the last Front-End Conf in this format. We'll be changing things up in the future.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="invite--personal">Hey Ben! You, me, and a bunch of other geeks wandering around Portland consuming their beverages. This has to happen. I'm supposed to go through Jody, but I couldn't resist.</p>
