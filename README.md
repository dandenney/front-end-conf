# Personal site, dandenney.com

This thing holds a series of words that I've spewed onto the internet since 2012. It's mainly so that I have a place to learn and play with front-end development, but also to keep my Google juice up against the guy with my name that created an airplane. Seriously, there's other Dan Denneys?

## Eleventy

Eleventy is amazing. It's a fast static-site generator that lets people use modern JS without making site visitors pay the price. I can't recommend it enough.

## Tailwind

This round is going to use Tailwind. I've been really curious about it and will see what I can do with it.

## Netlify

The best hosting, ever. Netlify is what would happen if you sat down and dreamt up what hosting should be. Plus, they've hired some of the best folks in the game.
